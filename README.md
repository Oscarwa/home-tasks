# HomeTasks project

This application will work as a task management platform for a home, being able to create, assign, and manage home chores and tasks and keep record of everything.

The catch will be gamification of tasks, meaning that completing tasks before due date/time, will grant you with points which can redeem for also configurable rewards.
